## About
This game was made entirely from scratch as a way for me to learn JavaScript (thats why it's full vanilla).  
Your goal is to reach the blue square and avoiding the red squares, using the arrows on your keyboard.  
Theres also some motivational sentences to help you through it :)

Have fun!
