## About
This game was made entirely from scratch as **a way for me to learn JavaScript** (you'll notice I didn't use prototypes, nor class sugar syntax, that's because I didn't even know how to properly implement objects in js back when I made this project, so **please** don't take this implementation as an example on how to properly implement a game in js).  

Your goal is to reach the blue square and avoiding the red squares, using the arrows on your keyboard.  
Theres also some motivational sentences to help you through it :)

Have fun!
